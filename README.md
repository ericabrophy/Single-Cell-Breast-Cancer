# Single-Cell-Breast-Cancer

Single cell RNA-seq of circulating breast cancer cells from 
19 women with ER+/HER2- primary tumours. Analysis of 74 single candidate circultaing tumor cells (CTCs) from two representative ER+/HER2- patients (BRx-42 and BRx-82) and 14 triple negative patients were isolated via micromanipulation and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing. The goal is to distinguish groups of HER2- and HER2+ CTCs to look at drug susceptibility and targeted/combination based therapies. The method used for analysis was Seurat, an R toolkit for single cell genomics.
